_This repo is an introductory exercise and my first approach to start learning OOP_


## Starting 🚀

_In order to run the app you first need to make a local copy of the repo. For this you need to copy the next command on your IDE console:_

```
git clone https://github.com/iarrieta90/OOP-Basics.git
```


### Requirements 📋

_You first need to have either PHP or a PHP-based local development server installed on your computer (such as XAMPP)_

_In case of using XAMPP, you need to put your clone of the project on its htdocs folder in order to be able to access it from the browser_


## Deploy 📦
